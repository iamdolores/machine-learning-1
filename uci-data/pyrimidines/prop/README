Dataset for Propositional Machine Learning
Learning Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs)
The Inhibition of Dihydrofolate Reductase by Pyrimidines



The data comes in 2 parts:
1) A 5-fold cross-validation series of 55 compounds
test[12345].ind
train[12345].ind
These correspond to the data described in:
King, Ross .D., Muggleton, Steven., Lewis, Richard. and Sternberg, Michael.J.E.
Drug Design by machine learning: the use of inductive logic programming 
to model the structure-activity relationships of trimethoprim analogues 
binding to dihydrofolate reductase. 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992, 89, 11322-11326.

2) An extra dataset of 19 compounds found after the original 55.
extra.ind
These are described in:

The problem is to learn the same greater activity relationship 
between pairs of compounds as in the accompanying ILP dataset.  
This is a way of using discrimination algorithms to do regression.

The examples are in attribute vector form. 
The fist no. is the class (0 or 1)
Each drug has 3 positions of possible substitution (345). 
There are 9 attributes for each substitution position
polar
size
flex
h_doner (I can't spell)
h_acceptor
pi_doner.
pi_acceptor
polarisable
sigma
This produces 27 attributes to describe each drug. 
As there are 2 drugs in each example this gives 54 attributes in total.  
The ordering is as above. 
The lack of a substitution, i.e. the chemical group H is specified by nine -1s.
All the attribute values are integers.
The examples are in the same order as the ILP examples.  For each 
example in the corresponding *.f file, the example is given, then 
its inverse.
