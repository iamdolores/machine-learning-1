Dataset for Regression
Learning Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs)
The Inhibition of Dihydrofolate Reductase by Pyrimidines



The data comes in 2 parts:
1) A 5-fold cross-validation series of 55 compounds
te[12345].dat
tr[12345].dat
These correspond to the data described in:
King, Ross .D., Muggleton, Steven., Lewis, Richard. and Sternberg, Michael.J.E.
Drug Design by machine learning: the use of inductive logic programming 
to model the structure-activity relationships of trimethoprim analogues 
binding to dihydrofolate reductase. 
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992, 89, 11322-11326.

2) An extra dataset of 19 compounds found after the original 55.
extra19_te.dat
These are described in:
King, Ross .D., Hurst, Jonathan. D.,  and Sternberg, Michael.J.E.

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships by neural networks and 
inductive logic programming: 1. The inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by 
pyrimidines. Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design, 1994 (in press).

The problem is to learn a regression equation/rule/tree to predict 
the activity from the descriptive structural attributes.


The examples are in attribute vector form. 
The fist no. is the activity of the compound.
Each drug has 3 positions of possible substitution (345). 
There are 9 attributes for each substitution position
polar
size
flex
h_doner (I can't spell)
h_acceptor
pi_doner.
pi_acceptor
polarisable
sigma
This produces 27 attributes to describe each drug. 

All the attribute values are real numbers.  They are rescaled between 0.1 and 0.9.

The ordering of the compounds is that given in Hurst et al.
