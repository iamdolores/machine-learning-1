Dataset for Regression
Learning Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs)
The Inhibition of Dihydrofolate Reductase by Traizines


The data is organised for 6 fold cross-validation series of 186 compounds

The data and methodology is described in detail in:

Hurst, Jonathan. D., King, Ross .D. and Sternberg, Michael.J.E.
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships by neural networks and 
inductive logic programming: 2. The inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by 
triazines. Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design, 1994 (in press).

The problem is to learn a regression equation/rule/tree to predict 
the activity from the descriptive structural attributes.


The examples are in attribute vector form. 
The fist no. is the activity of the compound.

Each drug has 6 positions of possible substitution. 
There are 10 attributes for each substitution position
polar
size
flex
h_doner (I can't spell)
h_acceptor
pi_doner.
pi_acceptor
polarisable
sigma
branch

The lack of a substitution, i.e. the chemical group H is specified by nine -0s.
All the attribute values are real numbers.  They are rescaled between 0.1 and 0.9.


The examples are in the order given in Hurst et al.
