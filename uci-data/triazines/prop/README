Dataset for Propositional Machine Learning
Learning Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs)
The Inhibition of Dihydrofolate Reductase by Triazines

The data is organised for 6 fold cross-validation series of 186 compounds
test[123456].ind
train[123456].ind

The data and methodology are described in detail in:

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships by neural networks and 
inductive logic programming: 2. The inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by 
triazines. Journal of Computer Aided Molecular Design, 1994 (in press).

The problem is to learn the same greater activity relationship 
between pairs of compounds as in the accompanying ILP dataset.  
This is a way of using discrimination algorithms to do regression.

The examples are in attribute vector form. 
The fist no. is the class (0 or 1)

Each drug has 6 positions of possible substitution. 
There are 10 attributes for each substitution position
polar
size
flex
h_doner (I can't spell)
h_acceptor
pi_doner.
pi_acceptor
polarisable
sigma
branch

This produces 60 attributes to describe each drug. 
As there are 2 drugs in each example this gives 120 attributes in total.  
The ordering is as above. 
The lack of a substitution, i.e. the chemical group H is specified by nine -1s.
All the attribute values are integers.
The examples are in the same order as the ILP examples.  For each 
example in the corresponding *.f file, the example is given, then 
its inverse.
